### üëâ What will your duties be?

As a **PhD candidate** in the Magnetism Group, you will:

- Develop expertise in **inelastic neutron scattering** to investigate **magnetic ground states**.
- Study **quantum fluctuations** and the nature of **quantum spin liquids** in correlated materials.
- Work closely with researchers in Prague and collaborate with international partners.
- Prepare and conduct **inelastic neutron scattering experiments** on **single crystals**.
- Analyze data and present findings in scientific publications and at conferences.
- Prepare and defend your PhD thesis.
- If you are more interrested in **crystal growth**, there is [another PhD position](/crystal-phd) for you.
