### üëâ What will your duties be?

As a **PhD candidate** in this position, you will:

- Grow single crystals using methods such as the **Bridgman method**, **Czochralski method**, and **Floating Zone techniques**.
- Work with **advanced furnace systems** including the **laser and optical furnaces for floating zone techniques**, and the **multi-zone furnaces for vapor transport**.
- Develop expertise in materials with complex magnetic and electronic properties.
- Perform structural determination and physical property measurements to analyze the grown crystals.
- Collaborate with an international team of researchers across the fields of **solid-state chemistry** and **condensed matter physics**.
- Prepare and defend your PhD thesis based on your original research.
- If you are on **neutron scattering**, there is [another PhD position](/neutron-phd) for you.
