The first official meeting for the BaCQueRel project took place during the 24th International Conference on Solid Compounds of Transition Elements [SCTE2024](https://www.scte2024.org/), held from June 17–21, 2024, at Hotel Duo in Prague, Czech Republic. This event brought together the teams from Augsburg University’s Centre for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism and Charles University’s Group of Magnetic Studies, marking the beginning of their collaborative efforts to explore quantum entanglement and spin fractionalization in frustrated magnetic materials.

The meeting provided an opportunity for key discussions on project goals, exchange of ideas, and alignment on methodologies. The participation in SCTE2024 allowed the teams to network with other experts in the field, reinforcing their shared vision of advancing quantum research through this cross-border initiative.
