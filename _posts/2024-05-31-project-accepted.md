Ross Colman of the Magnetism group at Charles University and Philipp Gegenwart Group of Augsburg University win funds to investigate Quantum Entanglement and Spin Fractionalisation.

This 2.5 year collaborative project totalling 460 k€, funded by the Bavarian Czech Academic Agency, will bring together and grow the expertise in both Augsburg University’s Centre for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism, with Charles University’s Group of Magnetic Studies in the Department of Condensed Matter Physics through team member and knowledge exchanges.

Entanglement is a key component in quantum computers and future quantum technologies. This project will develop a team of young scientists at doctoral student and postdoc level, to search for and unravel the mysteries of quantum entanglement in frustrated magnetic materials. The team will investigate promising candidate materials and look for the tell-tale signs of entanglement: deconfined spinon quasiparticle excitations, through the use of various transport measurements as well as nuclear-magnetic, muon, and neutron spectroscopies.
