# About

BaCQueRel is 2.5 year collaborative project totalling 460 k€, funded by the Bavarian Czech Academic Agency, will bring together and grow the expertise in both [Augsburg University](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/)’s [Centre for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/mntf/physik/groups/exp6/), with [Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/)’s [Group of Magnetic Studies](https://kfkl.mff.cuni.cz/en/mag) in the [Department of Condensed Matter Physics](https://kfkl.mff.cuni.cz/en/) through team member and knowledge exchanges.


## Join our team

The project will start in July 2024 and we need to hire 2 doctoral students and one postdoc. See [Hiring page](/hiring) for details!

## What is quantum entanglement?

Quantum entanglement describes the connection between particles whose properties depend on the state of all other particles, regardless of distance, resulting in non-local correlations. Macroscopically entangled quantum states, such as Bose-Einstein condensates or superconductors, demonstrate this phenomenon. Intermediate-scale quantum computers leverage entanglement in superconducting qubits for advanced calculations, and future quantum processors might utilize non-local entanglement for fault-tolerant computation. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are complex to study directly but can be modeled through indirect methods like inelastic neutron scattering, which measures spin excitations. Recent applications of quantum information theory to QSLs have confirmed entanglement, and this project aims to train young scientists in experimental techniques to characterize spinon quasiparticle excitations in novel QSL materials, advancing the understanding of quantum entanglement.
